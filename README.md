# SnapLensStudio-GrainGenerator
A film grain shader (post effect) for Snapchat's Lens Studio.
<br/>
It uses 0mb of your lens storage, so you don't need to use animated textures.
(It only uses about 4mb RAM.)

To use: simply import the shader file and drag it into a "Post Effects -> Color Correction" scene object. Or on a Screen Image. Then tweak it by selecting the shader in the Resources panel. 
<br/><br/>

Tip: In LS 3.0 and 3.1, the preview looks stretched on the front cam. Switching to the back cam in the preview window displays it correctly.
